<p><strong>The Flue Gas Desulfurization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Dry Flue Gas Desulphurization</li><li>Dry Flue Gas Desulphurization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) refers to processes used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants. The semi-dry FGD market utilizes a spray dryer absorber, where a slurry of lime or limestone is atomized into the gas stream, capturing SO2 as a solid. In contrast, dry FGD employs a dry sorbent, typically calcium-based materials, to absorb SO2 without water. Both methods aim to reduce environmental pollution from power generation facilities.</p></p>
